   - base too blocky on 1
   - label everything
   - 2nd floor fireplace doesn't work
   - more interesting footprint 
     - design in top view with basic shapes (circle, triangle, square)
   - decide on focal point
   - single function
   - label sketches 1,2,3...
   - need to understand the props
   - don't block important designs with walls
   - composition
   - flow of eye
   - rotate some objects so not everything is 90 degrees
   - "What does a ... have/need?"
** Homework
   - 3 more sketches, taking feedback into account
* Week 3 <2022-07-23 Sat>
** Critique
*** Other students
    - don't block pathways or entrances with objects
    - condense room into more compact space so you have fewer blank spots
    - foreground objects get higher priority
    - no repetition of furniture
    - keep 3d modeler in mind. They must be able to understand everything.
    - minimize straight lines
*** Me
    - MAKE NO TWO INTERVALS THE SAME!!!
      - analyze everthing in the image with this rule in mind
    - 1
      - improve layout of candle racks in sales area
      - candle shelves are too basic
      - more candle variation
      - partition areas of the room better
      - keep customers out of shop
      - move back stairs further away from front
      - ref for windows and wall materials
      - split focal points around. currently weighted to the left
    - 2
      - organic wall cutaway
      - racks more flush to wall
      - front desk is too long straight line.
      - break siloutte with candles
      - props for sales area
      - make space smaller
      - need to counter focal point
    - 3
      - big, medium, small candles
      - copy paste, but do slight mods on each paste
      - flag and shop name on exterior
        
** Homework
   - start 3d
   - can I combine the composition of #3 with elements from #1?
   - reference every prop

* Week 4 <2022-07-30 Sat>
** Critique
   - Try 24 mm
   - Don't turn in raw 3D. Sketch as much as possible to communicate idea.
   - Design focal points first, then other details if there's time
   - Check for walkable pathway through the scene
   - Check for tangents
   - Have clusters of details instead of filling in evenly
   - Variation in chimney design
   - zoom out
** Homework
   - Continue 3D
   - Design focal points, then everything else as time permits
* Week 5
** Questions
   - Do you render at a high resolution, or scale up in photoshop?
   - What to do about shadows and light direction?
   - Best render settings for a base to draw over?
