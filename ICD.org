* Week 3 <2022-07-23 Sat>
** Critique
*** Other students
    - don't block pathways or entrances with objects
    - condense room into more compact space so you have fewer blank spots
    - foreground objects get higher priority
    - no repetition of furniture
    - keep 3d modeler in mind. They must be able to understand everything.
    - minimize straight lines
*** Me
    - MAKE NO TWO INTERVALS THE SAME!!!
      - analyze everthing in the image with this rule in mind
    - 1
      - improve layout of candle racks in sales area
      - candle shelves are too basic
      - more candle variation
      - partition areas of the room better
      - keep customers out of shop
      - move back stairs further away from front
      - ref for windows and wall materials
      - split focal points around. currently weighted to the left
    - 2
      - organic wall cutaway
      - racks more flush to wall
      - front desk is too long straight line.
      - break siloutte with candles
      - props for sales area
      - make space smaller
      - need to counter focal point
    - 3
      - big, medium, small candles
      - copy paste, but do slight mods on each paste
      - flag and shop name on exterior
