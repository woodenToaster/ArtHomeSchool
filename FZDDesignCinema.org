   - Use photographs to get initial values
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 7
** Painting procedure
   - Sillouette
   - Subject, middleground, foreground, and background on layers to better control values

* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 84 - Designing to Spec
** Stages of Design
*** Thinking and research
    1. Pick a design problem (from books, old movies, old games)
    2. Understand the client needs
    3. Understand the subject matter
    4. Define the look and feel (overall mood)
       - Mood boards
    5. Write out the possible solutions and keywords
       - Possible locations and set designs
    6. Do research and gather references
*** Drawing and painting
    7. Start with rough thumbnails and ideation sketches
    8. Pick a few different design directions
    9. Refine the design and apply story driven details
    10. Use art skills to bring to final presentation level
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 89 - Just Draw!
** Tips for Getting Started
   - Don't worry about quality at first
   - Aim for about 50 studies per week, 20 minutes per study
   - Start with easy subject matters
   - Start with side views and orthos
   - Draw stuff you want to draw
   - Find joy in the process
** Suggested Progression
*** Organic and non-symmetrical objects
    1. Rock formations
    2. Old, gnarly trees
*** Symmetric, organic objects
    1. Animal bones and skulls
    2. Bugs and insects
    3. Bigger animals without hair
*** Organic and imprecise hard surfaces
    1. Old, hand-built buildings and huts
** Suggested Materials
   - A3 paper size
   - 20% grey or a picture of canson mi tientes
   - Default airbrush at 8 pixels
   - Each drawing on a different layer
   - Arrange finished drawings onto a "sketchbook" page and add labels
** Process
   - Linear block-in
   - Line weight
   - Contour lines
   - Grey wash for shadows and white paint for highlights
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 90 - 10 Beginner Drawing Tips
  1. Use cheap paper
     - 20% grey background
     - add some stray marks
  2. Start with easy stuff
     - side views, no perspective
     - organic forms that don't have to be perfect
     - forms that are less recognizable by the average person
  3. Draw loose but in control
  4. Use pen or avoid erasing
  5. Use thumbnails
  6. Add details later
  7. Practice line flow
  8. Practice line weight
  9. Cover your wall with drawings
  10. Repeat 1-9 thousands of times
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 94 - Form Follows Function
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 95 - Form Follows Function Complete Presentation
** Design from the inside out (form follows function):
    - Provides a starting point
    - Give a strong visual hook (probably more details)
    - Can help get over creative blocks
    - Tangible and believable
    - Adaptable and timeless
    - Easier
** Design Ideas
*** Design around natural causes of the Earth
     - Protection from the elements
     - Interesting locations
*** Design around man-made causes
    - overpopulation
    - pollution
*** Swap timelines
    - Combine multiple time periods
*** Show interesting real-world designs
    - Science
    - Culture
    - History
*** Real world period pieces
    - At least 50 years in the past
*** Remove functions
    - City without cars
*** Look to the past for visions of the future
    - Predictions of the future from the 1930s
*** Combine functions
    - Wind mills to power things other than grinding grain
    - Ancient cities in a modern style
*** Design solution = real world culture + time period + function
*** Design tips
    - Get and use good reference
    - Write down notes
    - Use sketches to sort out ideas
    - Use photo bashing to visualize the scene
    - Don't commit too early. Try multiple solutions
    - Keep it simple
    - 1) Collect reference, 2) take notes, 3) sketch
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 96 - Form Follows Function Environment Design
  1. Culture + time period + function = design
  2. Gather Reference
  3. List scenes that will best convey the design
  4. List key words to set the mood/tone.
  5. Draw rough comps of each scene.
  6. Add value/lighting to each scene.
  7. Do photobash painting for color comp
  8. Build in 3D
  9. Final painting
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 101 - Sketching 101
  1. Find horizon line
  2. Draw overall sillouette
     - Relax
     - Smooth, flowing lines
     - Big to small
  3. Add line weight
     - in shadow
     - form overlap
     - corners and creases
     - areas with weight (bottom of form)
     - start at focal point
  4. Add contour lines and details
  5. Marker wash
     - Darkest near focal point
     - Start light and build up (50% gray with 30% opacity)
  6. Highlights with pure white
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 102 - Intro to Digital Painting
** Suggested reference
   - Look for images with high contrast, full value range and atmospheric fog
   - Crop good compositions
   - 2.35 ratio for film, 1.77 for games
   - No colors
   - Organic
   - Loose perspective
   - Far shot, exterior
   - Overcast to avoid shadows
** Tips to build confidence
   - Don't use layers
   - Minimize undo. Paint out mistakes
   - No photo textures
   - Stick with 1 or 2 main default brushes
   - Avoid tricks like copy/paste, smudge, blur
   - Quality, not speed. Spend 20 hours on a painting
   - Use real world references
   - Copy film stills
   - Start with big forms, then refine details
   - Basics : dark, medium, light / foreground, midground, background
   - Start with 50% grey canvas
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 103 - Intro to Design
** Pick a design (game, film)
** Understand the design's influences (from creator's POV)
    - What moods does it evoke?
    - What words does it bring to mind? Choose 5 key words.

** Pick a favorite design to finalize
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 104 - Environmental Composition
** Camera Position
   - Be a tourist

* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 107 - How to Add Details
** Breaking Down Details
   - Silhouette
   - 2nd level details :: help define (break) silhouette
   - 3rd level details :: help define 2nd level details
   - 2nd and 3rd level details also each have their own 1,2,3 read, recursively,
     which become 4th and 5th level details
   - Focus on 1 and 2 in beginning stages
** First Read
   - Instantaneous shape recognition
** 1,2,3 Distance Rule
   - 3 feet :: silhouette
   - 1 foot :: 2nd level details are part of silhouette
   - 1 foot and focusing :: 2nd and 3rd level details support
   - Start with solid foundaton 
** Visual Focus
   - Put details where the eye tends to focus
   - Don't put details where the eye won't land
   - More secondary details = more visually interesting, and easier to make cool
** Start with one role
   - One job for one area/character, one architecture style
