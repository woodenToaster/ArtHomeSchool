* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 95 - Form Follows Function
** Design from the inside out (form follows function):
    - Provides a starting point
    - Give a strong visual hook (probably more details)
    - Can help get over creative blocks
    - Tangible and believable
    - Adaptable and timeless
    - Easier
** Design Ideas
*** Design around natural causes of the Earth
     - Protection from the elements
     - Interesting locations
*** Design around man-made causes
    - overpopulation
    - pollution
*** Swap timelines
    - Combine multiple time periods
*** Show interesting real-world designs
    - Science
    - Culture
    - History
*** Real world period pieces
    - At least 50 years in the past
*** Remove functions
    - City without cars
*** Look to the past for visions of the future
    - Predictions of the future from the 1930s
*** Combine functions
    - Wind mills to power things other than grinding grain
    - Ancient cities in a modern style
*** Design solution = real world culture + time period + function
*** Design tips
    - Get and use good reference
    - Write down notes
    - Use sketches to sort out ideas
    - Use photo bashing to visualize the scene
    - Don't commit too early. Try multiple solutions
    - Keep it simple
    - 1) Collect reference, 2) take notes, 3) sketch
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 96
  1. Culture + time period + function = design
  2. Gather Reference
  3. List scenes that will best convey the design
  4. List key words to set the mood/tone.
  5. Draw rough comps of each scene.
  6. Add value/lighting to each scene.
  7. Do photobash painting for color comp
  8. Build in 3D
  9. Final painting
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 104 - Environmental Composition
** Camera Position
   - Be a tourist
   - No ladders or cranes (no crazy angles)
   - Keep eye level under human head height.
   - Stick with head, chest, waist, thigh or ground
   - Have a clear focal point or subject matter. No cropping.
** FOV
   - Wide enough angle to show the whole scene
** Composition
   - Foreground :: reference for scale (human or human sized object)
   - Midground :: subject matter or focal point
   - Background :: context and breathing room
* FZD Design Cinema Ep. 105 - Time Management
Time breakdown of a 3-day piece of art
** Day 0
   - Gather reference
** Day 1
   - 10 AM - 3 PM :: Super rough sketches, thumbnails. Get designs out. Side
                     views, no difficult perspective. (brain power)
   - 3 PM - 7 PM :: Choose design, rough sketch, lock camera, good perspective (muscle memory)
** Day 2
   - 10 AM - 1 PM :: Clean up, figure stuff out (not final drawing) (brain power)
   -  1 PM - 7 PM :: Build in 3D or polish drawing (muscle memory)
** Day 3
   - 10 AM - 7 PM :: Polish for presentation (muslce memory)
