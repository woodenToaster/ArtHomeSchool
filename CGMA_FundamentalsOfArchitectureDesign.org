* Goals
** Collect good reference
   - Be creative with search terms
   - Pull from games and film
   - Look for essential elements
** Sketch from reference
   - Start with basic shapes
   - Look at ref, then sketch. Don't copy 1:1.
   - Stay loose
   - Start with one point and orthos
   - Pay attention to ideation
** Sketch from imagination
   - Start with essential structure
   - Complexity can always be added on top of essential structure
   - Write keywords from reference to capture look and feel
   - Latch on to cool elements and push them farther
   - "How does this thing work?" Form follows function.
** Incorporate reference into your work
** Finalize your designs
* TODO Asian Architecture
** DONE One page of sketches from reference and imagination
** DONE Combine sketches.
    - Group ones with similar perspective.
    - Cut, copy, paste, transform
** DONE Refine 3-4 sketches
    - Blow up sketch, lower opacity, and draw over
    - Focus on design. Solve all the problems.
    - Use correct perspective
    - Put the subject into a scene
** TODO Loosely finalize one of your designs
    - Photo textures
    - Paint over
    - Atmospheric scene
* TODO Indian Architecture (Indo-Islamic)
** DONE One page of sketches from reference and imagination
** DONE Combine sketches.
    - Fill in sketches with a solid grey like a silouette
** TODO Refine 3-4 sketches
    - Experiment with layer blending modes
** TODO Loosely finalize one of your designs
* TODO Ancient Architecture
* TODO Classical Architecture
* TODO Medieval Architecture
