* Marshall Vandruff's Perspective Lectures
** 01 - Intro
   - Oblique lines are lines that are neither right angles nor parallel.
     - Obtuse angle is > 90 degrees
     - Acute angle is < 90 degrees
   - 5 Ways to Create the Illusion of depth
     - Diminution
     - Foreshortening
     - Convergence of parallel lines
     - Aerial or Atmospheric perspective
     - Overlapping
   - Three dimensions
     - x is left and right
     - y is up and down
     - z is front and back
     - In a front or back view, z is completely foreshortened
     - In a top or bottom view, y is completely foreshortened
     - In a side view, x is completely foreshortened
     - Oblique view is another term for 3/4 view
*** TODO Draw cubes at every angle
      - Start with cubes
      - Next, move to everyday objects reduced to boxes
      - Build up the complex forms in the box, relating every line to the box
      - Compare draft views (top, side, and front) with oblique view
      - Simplify complexity by using simple forms
* Marshall Vandruff's Perspective Assignments
** TODO Form Analysis 1 - Box it Up
   - Simplify a 3d form in a 3/4 view and reduce it only to boxes.
** Form Analysis 2 - Draft and Oblique
** Form Analysis 3 - New Position from Imagination

* Perspective Drawing Handbook - Joseph D'Amelio
** Chapter 1 - Fundamentals
   - Diminution - Objects appear smaller as their distance from the viewer
     increases
   - Foreshortening - Lines or surfaces parallel to the observer's face show
     their maximum size. As they are revolved away from the observer, they
     appear increasingly shorter.
   - Convergence - Lines which are parallel in reality appear to converge as
     they recede from the observer. Diminution plus foreshortening.
   - Overlapping - closer objects overlap more distant objects.
   - Shade and Shadows - the way light falls on a 3d object gives it its form
   - Color and value perspective - color and values become grayer, weaker and
     more neutral as their distance from the observer increases.
   - Detail and Pattern Perspective - details and textures become fuzzier when
     far away.
   - Focus Effect - If they eye is focused on a distant object, the foreground
     becomes blurred, and vice versa. This technique is rarely used.
** Chapter 3 - How We See for Perspective Drawing
   - Central visual ray is center and focus of cone of vision, which is 45-60
     degrees.
   - Picture plane is between viewer and subject and is perpendicular to central
     visual ray.
   - Canvas or piece of paper is the picture plane.
** Chapter 4 - Why Appearance Differs from Reality
   - Diminution happens because of the way lines of sight hit the picture plane.
   - Convergance happens because lines of sight of the far ends appear closer
     together on the picture plane the the near ends.
   - Foreshortening happens because lines of sight get closer together on the
     picture plane as an object points toward or away from the viewer.
   - Overlapping objects prevent lines of sight from hitting the picture plane.
