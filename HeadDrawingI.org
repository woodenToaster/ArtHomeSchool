* Watts Head Phase I
** Head Lay-ins
   - Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, decade goals
   - TODO Draw different angles several times for several hours each until you
     can draw them from memory
   - TODO Warm up with large, clean ovals and circles for 5 minutes
   - Start 3/4 head with a circle
   - Lop off the side with an ellipse
   - Put in ellipse axes
   - Minor axes becomes brow line
   - Pull center line of face plane
   - Bring face plane down in a taper to chin from each side of the ball
   - Jaw angles back up to ellipse major axis
   - TODO Hairline to brow is 1/3. Repeat that length twice on a frontal view.
   - Arc from the bottom corner of side plane through center and over forehead
     can find the hairline
   - TODO 3/4 heads using the rule of thirds
** Skull profile
   - Start with horizontal oval (or egg on its side)
   - Remember to vary line weight
   - TODO Draw profile, straight on, and 3/4 views of skull
