* Week 1 - <2022-05-15 Sun>
  - charles-lin@live.com
  - Visualizing in 3D
  - Plot perfect square enough times until you can eyeball it
  - TODO: Check out Centaur World
** Syllabus
   - Week 1 :: Proportions
     - Simplifying forms
   - Week 2 :: Bugs
     - Proportional breakdown
   - Week 3 :: Large Animals
     - Organic forms
     - Surface transition
   - Week 4 :: Hard Surface (cars)
     - Details and scale
   - Week 5 :: Sci-Fi
** TODO A3 sheet of parallel straight lines
   - let pen rest at end of line
   - Do it as professionally as you would if you were getting paid for it
** TODO Handwriting exercise
   - Fill 3 A3 pages with text. All letters must be exactly the same
** TODO Perspective vehicles
   - Choose a blocky vehicle (tractor)
   - Create inventory list of basic 6-8 parts as simple forms
   - Proportions
     - Identify keystone object: unit of proportion
     - List out proportions in terms of keystone object
     - Draw object in plan (side) view in proportion
   - Drawing
     - Consider camera (POV)
     - Decide on position of HL and VPs
     - Set up a grid
     - Plot in proportional (orthogonal) grid
       - center plane
       - extrude one side and mirror it to the other
     - Clean up
     - Add line weight (thicker for closer objects)
     - Thicken lines that make contact with the ground
       
* Week 2 <2022-05-22 Sun>
  - Viscom
    - Sense of volume, 3D, penmanship
    - Do both precise and loose drawings
  - Studies
    - Visual library
  - Design
    - Sense of aesthetics
    - Proportions
  - Bugs (intermediate subject)
  - Attractive design: Big, medium, small for all elements
  - TODO Analyze art you like for big, medium, small
  - Insects break down into 3 components
    - head
    - thorax
    - abdomen
  - Spiders break down into
    - mandibles
    - head
    - abdomen
** Process
   - Establish a checklist
     - Select subject matter (don't spend more than 10 minutes)
     - Select camera (think about the POV you want)
     - Create an inventory
     - Block in elements. 2 options:
       - Mid-plane extrusion
       - Block in shapes, and cut in
     - Line weight
       - Constructions lines vs. object lines
     - Shadows
       - cast shadow on ground plane
         - requires ground plane, draw through, max width and length
       - cast shadow on self
     - Flat colors
     - Set 1,2,3 values
   - Perspective ground plane
   - Anchor lines for limbs
   - Make presentation nice
* Week 3 <2022-05-29 Sun>
  - Blocky animal first, then more refined
  - Play up the unique characteristics of the animal
  - Ground shadow: rotate canvas and shift draw straight lines
** Blocky Process
   - Inventory
   - Proportion
   - POV and camera
** More realistic process
   - Block in main forms and proportions lightly
   - pull the blocked in forms into perspective
   - still drawing through and capturing symmetry
   - always maintain the center line
   - always shift the perspective when studying from reference
* Week 4 <2022-06-05 Sun>
  - To go from simple curves to complex forms is just more boxes (higher resolution) 
  - Create a perfect cube cheat sheet
* Week 5 <2022-06-12 Sun>
