   - Franklin Booth
** Objectives
   - Line confidence
   - Process
   - See perspective
     - Free hand
     - Doesn't have to be perfect
   - Drawing in 3D (volume)
   - Break down different subject matter
   - Apply technical skill
   - Learn how to learn
** Lecture Notes
   - Optional homework: have fun drawing
     - Good draftmanship doesn't make you a good artist or designer
   - Keep personal goal in mind to maintain focus
   - TODO: Note down when you feel frustrated.
   - Faber Castell fineliners
     - Xs, s, f
   - Derwent grey fineliner (pencil substitute)
   - Toned marker, 2 - 4
   - 8.5 x 11 sketchbook 75 lb artists loft (Michaels)
   - Zebra brush pens
   - Pentel stylo (fineliner brush pen hybrid)
   - Big pen for blocking in shadows
*** Process
    - No pencil, ruler, eraser, ballpoint
    - Grey fineliners and copics for construction lines
    - Vary fineliner size to vary line weight
    - Break down subject into basic shapes
*** Principles of Sketching
    - Line: quality and accuracy
    - Perspective: visualizing objects sitting in the same space
    - Form and volume (3D)
    - Modification: organic vs rigid body
    - Form sensitivity: details, textures
    - Rendering: show form and perspective, show light and shadow
    - Proportion: dont' try to study simultaneously with everything else
    - Design: choices, communicating clearly instead of just copying
*** Homework
**** 1 page of lines, circles and ellipses
**** 1 page diagonals and curves
**** 1 page of organic forms and disections
**** 1 page of boxes from observation
**** 1 page of boxes from sketchfab or imagination
**** 8-10  2" x 2" Textures, half from life
     - Still thinking about form (depth, overlap)
     - How will they be applied to a surface?
     - What distance will they be drawn at?
     - Vary material and distance (zoomed in, zoomed out)
     - Crop reference and copy, then invent from shapes
     - Use line, shape, and in between with hatching.
     - 3 values, white, black, and 50%
***** 1. Structure
      - xs pen
      - Focus on clear shadow edges
      - Short, broken lines
      - Don't completely close off shapes in frame
      - Find shapes instead of framing
      - Build your own library of shapes from the texture
      - Create your own interpretation of the texture
***** 2. Darkest value
      - Fill in darkest values 
***** 3. 50% value
      - Fill in 50% value
      - Vary hatching lines
