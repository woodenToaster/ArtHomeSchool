* Week 1 <2022-05-15 Sun>
** Artists
   - Kate Selkie
   - Franklin Booth
** Objectives
   - Line confidence
   - Process
   - See perspective
     - Free hand
     - Doesn't have to be perfect
   - Drawing in 3D (volume)
   - Break down different subject matter
   - Apply technical skill
   - Learn how to learn
** Lecture Notes
   - Optional homework: have fun drawing
     - Good draftmanship doesn't make you a good artist or designer
   - Keep personal goal in mind to maintain focus
   - TODO: Note down when you feel frustrated.
   - Faber Castell fineliners
     - Xs, s, f
   - Derwent grey fineliner (pencil substitute)
   - Toned marker, 2 - 4
   - 8.5 x 11 sketchbook 75 lb artists loft (Michaels)
   - Zebra brush pens
   - Pentel stylo (fineliner brush pen hybrid)
   - Big pen for blocking in shadows
*** Process
    - No pencil, ruler, eraser, ballpoint
    - Grey fineliners and copics for construction lines
    - Vary fineliner size to vary line weight
    - Break down subject into basic shapes
*** Principles of Sketching
    - Line: quality and accuracy
    - Perspective: visualizing objects sitting in the same space
    - Form and volume (3D)
    - Modification: organic vs rigid body
    - Form sensitivity: details, textures
    - Rendering: show form and perspective, show light and shadow
    - Proportion: dont' try to study simultaneously with everything else
    - Design: choices, communicating clearly instead of just copying
*** Homework
**** 1 page of lines, circles and ellipses
**** 1 page diagonals and curves
**** 1 page of organic forms and disections
**** 1 page of boxes from observation
**** 1 page of boxes from sketchfab or imagination
**** 8-10  2" x 2" Textures, half from life
     - Still thinking about form (depth, overlap)
     - How will they be applied to a surface?
     - What distance will they be drawn at?
     - Vary material and distance (zoomed in, zoomed out)
     - Crop reference and copy, then invent from shapes
     - Use line, shape, and in between with hatching.
     - 3 values, white, black, and 50%
***** 1. Structure
      - xs pen
      - Focus on clear shadow edges
      - Short, broken lines
      - Don't completely close off shapes in frame
      - Find shapes instead of framing
      - Build your own library of shapes from the texture
      - Create your own interpretation of the texture
***** 2. Darkest value
      - Fill in darkest values 
***** 3. 50% value
      - Fill in 50% value
      - Vary hatching lines

* Week 2 <2022-05-22 Sun>
** Critique
   - Connect shadows
   - Think about overall light direction
   - Lose lines in light (oversaturate)
** Basic Forms
   - Study planes as an approach to boxes in perspective
   - Box: bigger face is less convergance, and vice versa
   - Draw boxes on a ground plane.
** Modifications
   - Different color for modifications
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Exploded views
   - Intersections
   - Rounded corners
   - Everything by hand and eyeballed.
** Rendering
   - Material is icing on the base form
   - highlight: points closest to light (make minimal)
   - cast shadow and form shadow
   - halftone
   - Ambient occlusion
** Surfacing
   - Brightest plane: least detail, area of rest
   - Balanced: detailed (like texture study)
   - Darkest: less detail
   - Thin lines for structure of texture
   - Keep perspective in mind
   - 3D (break edges)
   - Big brush pens for darkest face, hatch the rest
   - Can tone down with marker
   - Think about overall gradient from light
   - Balanced side: fill in shadows based on light direction
     - hatch like texture thumbnails
** Subjects
*** Abstract organics
    - coral, deadwood, rocks
*** Rocks
    - Start with perspective box, carve into general shape
    - Focus on plane changes, amount of detail
    - Reference with at least 2 visible planes
    - Contours where the form is really jagged
    - Read rendering in pen and ink
    - Try some rocks from imagination
* Week 3 <2022-05-29 Sun>
** Critique
   - Connect light shapes as well as shadow shapes
   - More texture lines near edge of form does double duty as shadow
   - Flat, consistent hatching lines can flatten out textures. Vary direction.
** Lecture
*** Rock formations
    - Break up large rock formations into smaller
    - Group smaller forms instead of drawing each one
    - Design the reference before beginning to draw
*** Plants
**** Groups
     - Trees
     - Grass
     - Foilage
**** Form heavy objects
     - cacti
     - mushrooms
     - fruits and veg
**** Sheets
     - Petals
     - leaves
**** Process
***** thumbnails
      - silhouettes and groups
      - Add ground plane for trees in perspective
***** structure
***** line
      - form sensitivity
      - subdivide groups
***** rendering
      - 2 value study on thumbnail (brush pen)
      - find terminator
      - Block in darkest shadows
      - render shadow (texture, form, value)
      - half tone (fine pen, less texture, stay near terminator)
      - leaves (decide what kind of marks to use for each leaf type)
***** highlights
      - wrap shapes where light is
      - try white pencil
*** Organic modifications
    - tapered, twisted, folded cylinders
    - overlapping form comes to front
    - get perspective of each object to make overlap easier
    - melting boxes
    - xyz section drawing (free hand)
    - google imperfect vegetable ads
*** Fruit
    - Get sense of the volume with contour lines
    - Start with basic forms and carve in/out
*** Flowers
    - Sheets (pedals) are planes
    - Start with overall forms
    - work from closest to camera to farthest away (auto overlap)
    - block in 2d shapes of pedals with thin pen
    - can group farthest pedals
    - line (form sensitivity)
** Homework
   - Try to draw from life
   - Include ref in discord
   - Try to thumbnail from a different angle than you're seeing it
   - Draw pot when drawing potted plants
*** 1 page cylinders from life

    - try rotations (optional)
*** 7 pages of plants
    - 3 from life
    - groups, forms, and sheets

* Week 4 <2022-06-05 Sun>
** Critique
   - Design light and dark groups better
   - Use more variety in hatching
** Lecture
*** Artists
    - Sergio Toppi
*** Rotations
*** Skeletal Forms
    - Think of a skeleton as a rig or the structure
    - Approach as subject matter (complex organic form)
    - Rotate and draw 3d models of single bones
    - Proportions aren't the main focus right now
**** Process
     - Break down each major form into a simple shape
     - Get comfortable rotating these simple shapes
     - Get ref from as many angles as possible
     - Start with skull
     - Attach spine to skull
     - Rib cage (not a simple cylinder)
     - Pelvis (just a plane)
     - Group the limbs with sticks
     - Draw the simplified skeleton from a different POV
*** Skulls
    - Cranium
    - Orbit
    - Nasal bone and maxilla
    - Mandible
    - Zygomatic arch
    - L for length and height proportion
    - Cross of brow and nasal bone determines perspective
    - Start with basic shape in perspective, then carve out the form
*** Skeletons
    - spine
    - rib cage
    - pelivs
    - legs
    - Start with simplified stick figure
    - Focus on rib frequency rather than counting them out
*** Homework
    - 2 pages of rotations (10-15 per page)
      - 1 from sketchfab (cube)
      - 1 from life
    - 4 pages of skulls

* Week 5 <2022-06-19 Sun>
** Critique
   - Round the ribs more
   - Remember perspective recession with eye sockets
** Lecture
   - For assignments this week, aim for understanding. "How does this work?"
   1. components (side view)
   2. mass and volume
   3. perspective
   4. proportions
   5. weight
   6. surfacing
   7. movement
*** Side views
    - focus on components, proportions, and features
    - Repeat side views like thumbnails
    - no detail
    - reptiles: angular on top and round on bottom
*** 3/4 views
    - construction is 3D
    - more volume towards head and less towards tail (fish)
    - Start angular and work towards organic when necessary
    - understand form in thumbnails before attempting final drawing
    - draw through to place back legs
*** Feature studies (face, feet, tail, texture)
    - study proportions and shapes
    - lean into animal's specific characteristics
    - Use hatching in opposite direction to distinguish shadow from local value
*** Motion
    - Start with sphere and center line
    - Use videos for reference
*** Fully rendered
    - draw bigger
    - compose multiple fish in the same scene with correct perspective
** Homework
*** DONE Design assignments first
