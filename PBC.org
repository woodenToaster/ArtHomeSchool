* Week 1 <2022-06-14 Tue>
** Nero pencil (charcoal and wax)
** DONE Put introduction in discord
*** art goals
*** hopes for this class
** Course Structure
   - Feel free to come and go (long class!)
   - Ask questions.
   - Perspective isn't as useful as it used to be
   - Traditional materials
     - colored pencils
     - tracing paper
     - Krita better suited to drawing than photoshop
** Warmups
   - Focus on body movements, not result
   - Keep wrist straight
   - Split warmups up among several days
   - connect 2 points
     - "hand loose" distance
     - slide elbow
     - go over each line 3 times
     - find sweet spot between accuracy and confidence
   - draw circles
     - make boxes within horizontal lines
     - put hatch marks in center of each quadrant
     - start light, go around 5 or 6 times, darkening down
     - pencil works better
   - ellipses
     - vertical lines a knuckle apart
     - same strategy as circles
     - no tilting, no lopsided, no pinching
   - line quality
     - need thin to thick tool
     - thinnest, lightest possible to thickest heaviest possible
     - long, even transition
     - thick to thin
     - thin to thick
     - thin thick thin
     - thick thin thick
** 1-point perspective
   - perspective less helpful for objects off grid
   - put VP roughly in center
   - each object on a layer can simplify complicated images
   - cleaner intersections are more reliable
   - thinner line weight for objects close and towards the light.
** 2-point perspective
   - wide aspect ratio is better for homework
   - different color for each VP
** Subdividing and cloning
   - project height
   - project width
   - clone an object
   - clone into different space
   - subdividing
** Inclined planes
   - horizon in middle
   - construction method
   - ? project widths from ground plane to inclined planes
** Combining forms
   
* Week 2 <2022-06-21 Tue>
** Warmups
   - lines at every angle with static page
     - practice angles that are hardest
   - connect 3 dots with a smooth curve
     - curve apex at middle dot
     - go over three times
   - ellipses
     - 3 columns
     - start with circle, reduce degree 5-10% per ellipse
     - fat to thin and thin to fat
   - connected curves
     - draw first curve, go over 3 times
     - start back from end of first curve and append an S curve
     - focus on seamless connection
     - vary ratio of sides, deep/shallow, orientation
** Cone of Vision
   - Sometimes you want distortion, most of the time you don't
** Pyramids
   - standard
   - truncated
   - normal roof
   - roof with corners tilted in/out
   - tiered
     - over 3 steps, use 3D
** Curves on rectilinear forms
   - 3 points, middle is peak
   - transfer points from one face to another
   - map out curves with pencil
** Perfect squares
   - cut angle in half to find roughtly 45 degree measuring line
     - not 100% accurate
** Ellipses
   - X gives 4 points, then find half way point of each diagonal and come back a bit
   - Digital method: perfect circle on separate layer. Transform it to align the corners to a perfect square
** Architecture Breakdowns
   - Trace photo before starting to understand the forms
   - leave out unneeded measuring lines
   - use symmetrical scaling to scale some thickness into the roof
** Homework
   - cylinders
     - do a few the long way

* Week 3 <2022-06-28 Tue>
** Warmups
*** Practicing accurate angles
    - draw a vertical line
    - estimate half way point
    - draw 90 degree angle
    - go over it 3 times
    - bisect horizontal line for 2 45 degree angle
    - repeat again for 22.5 degree angles
    - Check with a protractor
    - Repeat exercise but start at outside and draw towards center point
    - Fill spokes with ellipses or circles
    - Can vary initial direction (up, down, left, right)
*** Complex subdivisions
    - start with midpoints
    - adjust to get correct division
    - do with straight lines and circles
    - try odd numbered rectangular grid (e.g., 3x5)
*** Ellipse in planes
    - draw a perspective plane
    - find center and center of each side
    - draw ellipse crossing bisection points
    - can also estimate midpoints with tick mark
*** Receding ellipses
    - draw a long plane in perspective
    - estimate a perfect square
    - duplicate it back in perspective
    - draw ellipses in each square
    - do vertical and horizontal planes
*** Ellipses on cube faces
** Lecture
*** Arched cutaways
    - put perfect square half on a block and draw an ellipse
    - project through to the other side
    - eyeballing back side saves a lot of time
*** Spheres
    - practical method
      - horizontal square plane
      - fit ellipse into plane
*** Domes
    - For horizontal, make a sphere, then erase bottom half
    - For vertical, can place in long box for elongated domes
*** Rotations
    - 90 degrees at station point to create sets of VPs
    - Check out Dan Beardshaw's youtube channel on rotations
*** 3-point Perspective
*** Brewer Grids
    - start with desired angles of convergence
    - for vertical lines, start at center, then progressively add slightly tilted line on each side
** Homework
   - draw on brewer grid (except for spheres)
   - vehicles
     - stick to blocky vehicles
     - start with simple breakdown (inventory)
     - don't focus on proportion
     - longer lines ensure more accuracy
     - use 3 axes as minimal grid
   - at least 1 full sphere construction 

* Week 4 <2022-07-05 Tue>
** Warmups
    - straight lines (go over 3 times), even space between them
      - make a square out of 2 horizontal lines
      - draw large circle in the square
      - the point is trying to control a large circle
      - draw small circles within the large
      - four corner pieces should be same size
    - fit a curve into a box
      - corners should be similar
      - drop midpoint down and draw another similar curve
      - repeat
      - place three dots and connect
    - same curve exercise but without the initial structure
    - do other symmetric shapes within shapes
      - correct each shape before moving to next level
      - focus on even distances between each shape
    - free hand compound forms
      - ~3 shapes per form
      - a cutaway is also a shape

  - Camera angle exercise
    - Rotate camera of a reference image
    - Can use handmade grid, 3d grid, or floor plan method
    - Frame after blocking in big and medium shapes.
      - Focus on pleasing composition with frame
  - Start with photo block-in, then adapt to your own world/idea
    - Trace big forms from photo
    - Choose different setting/reference for medium and small shapes
