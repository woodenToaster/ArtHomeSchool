#+STARTUP: nologdone

* Week 1
** Nero pencil (charcoal and wax)
** DONE Put introduction in discord
*** art goals
*** hopes for this class
** Course Structure
   - Feel free to come and go (long class!)
   - Ask questions.
   - Perspective isn't as useful as it used to be
   - Traditional materials
     - colored pencils
     - tracing paper
     - Krita better suited to drawing than photoshop
** Warmups
   - Focus on body movements, not result
   - Keep wrist straight
   - Split warmups up among several days
   - connect 2 points
     - "hand loose" distance
     - slide elbow
     - go over each line 3 times
     - find sweet spot between accuracy and confidence
   - draw circles
     - make boxes within horizontal lines
     - put hatch marks in center of each quadrant
     - start light, go around 5 or 6 times, darkening down
     - pencil works better
   - ellipses
     - vertical lines a knuckle apart
     - same strategy as circles
     - no tilting, no lopsided, no pinching
   - line quality
     - need thin to thick tool
     - thinnest, lightest possible to thickest heaviest possible
     - long, even transition
     - thick to thin
     - thin to thick
     - thin thick thin
     - thick thin thick
** 1-point perspective
   - perspective less helpful for objects off grid
   - put VP roughly in center
   - each object on a layer can simplify complicated images
   - cleaner intersections are more reliable
   - thinner line weight for objects close and towards the light.
** 2-point perspective
   - wide aspect ratio is better for homework
   - different color for each VP
** Subdividing and cloning
   - project height
   - project width
   - clone an object
   - clone into different space
   - subdividing
** Inclined planes
   - horizon in middle
   - construction method
   - ? project widths from ground plane to inclined planes
** Combining forms

* Week 2
** Warmups
   - lines at every angle with static page
     - practice angles that are hardest
   - connect 3 dots with a smooth curve
     - curve apex at middle dot
     - go over three times
   - ellipses
     - 3 columns
     - start with circle, reduce degree 5-10% per ellipse
     - fat to thin and thin to fat
   - connected curves
     - draw first curve, go over 3 times
     - start back from end of first curve and append an S curve
     - focus on seamless connection
     - vary ratio of sides, deep/shallow, orientation
** Cone of Vision
   - Sometimes you want distortion, most of the time you don't
** Pyramids
   - standard
   - truncated
   - normal roof
   - roof with corners tilted in/out
   - tiered
     - over 3 steps, use 3D
** Curves on rectilinear forms
   - 3 points, middle is peak
   - transfer points from one face to another
   - map out curves with pencil
** Perfect squares
   - cut angle in half to find roughtly 45 degree measuring line
     - not 100% accurate
** Ellipses
   - X gives 4 points, then find half way point of each diagonal and come back a bit
   - Digital method: perfect circle on separate layer. Transform it to align the corners to a perfect square
** Architecture Breakdowns
   - Trace photo before starting to understand the forms
   - leave out unneeded measuring lines
   - use symmetrical scaling to scale some thickness into the roof
** Homework
   - cylinders
     - do a few the long way
