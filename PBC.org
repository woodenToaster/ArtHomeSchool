* Week 1
** Nero pencil (charcoal and wax)
** TODO Put introduction in discord
*** art goals
*** hopes for this class
** Course Structure
   - Feel free to come and go (long class!)
   - Ask questions.
   - Perspective isn't as useful as it used to be
   - Traditional materials
     - colored pencils
     - tracing paper
     - Krita better suited to drawing than photoshop
** Warmups
   - Focus on body movements, not result
   - Keep wrist straight
   - Split warmups up among several days
   - connect 2 points
     - "hand loose" distance
     - slide elbow
     - go over each line 3 times
     - find sweet spot between accuracy and confidence
   - draw circles
     - make boxes within horizontal lines
     - put hatch marks in center of each quadrant
     - start light, go around 5 or 6 times, darkening down
     - pencil works better
   - ellipses
     - vertical lines a knuckle apart
     - same strategy as circles
     - no tilting, no lopsided, no pinching
   - line quality
     - need thin to thick tool
     - thinnest, lightest possible to thickest heaviest possible
     - long, even transition
     - thick to thin
     - thin to thick
     - thin thick thin
     - thick thin thick
** 1-point perspective
   - perspective less helpful for objects off grid
   - put VP roughly in center
   - each object on a layer can simplify complicated images
   - cleaner intersections are more reliable
   - thinner line weight for objects close and towards the light.
** 2-point perspective
   - wide aspect ratio is better for homework
   - different color for each VP
** Subdividing and cloning
   - project height
   - project width
   - clone an object
   - clone into different space
   - subdividing
** Inclined planes
   - horizon in middle
   - construction method
   - ? project widths from ground plane to inclined planes
** Combining forms
